static DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(sc_wq);
This macro:
    Declares a variable of type wait_queue_head_t,
    Initializes it using init_waitqueue_head().
    
    wait_queue_head_t sc_wq;
    init_waitqueue_head(&sc_wq);
    
This declares and initializes a wait queue head named sc_wq as a static global variable in the kernel module.

A wait queue in Linux is a kernel mechanism used for managing sleeping (blocked) processes. It allows a process to sleep (i.e., voluntarily stop running) until a particular condition becomes true â€” for example:

    data becomes available,
    an event happens,
    hardware triggers an interrupt, etc.

Think of it as:
    "Put this process to sleep until something wakes it up."
